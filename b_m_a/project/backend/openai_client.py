# Steps:
- Analyze the input text to extract key pieces of knowledge, concepts, or important details.
- Generate a variety of question types based on the extracted information:{question_types_instruction}
- Ensure questions are clear, relevant to the input text, and appropriately varied in difficulty.
- Generate exactly {num_questions} questions, balancing the different question types proportionally.
- Provide correct answers and explanation details (if relevant) for all question types.

### Field Explanation:
- **quiz_title**: A concise, topic-relevant title for the quiz, inferred from the provided text.  
- **type**: Denotes the question type ("multiple_choice", "multi_select", "drag_and_drop", "short_answer", "fill_in_blank").  
- **question**: The main question or task.  
- **options**: For multiple-choice and multi-select questions, a list of answer options.  
- **correct_answer**: The correct choice for "multiple_choice" questions (a single string).  
- **correct_answers**: A list of all correct answers for "multi_select".  
- **prompts**: In drag-and-drop, the items the user will drag.  
- **targets**: In drag-and-drop, the drop zones or categories where items belong.  
- **correct_mapping**: A dictionary showing the correct drag-and-drop pairings.  
- **acceptable_answers**: For "short_answer" and "fill_in_blank", a list of alternative correct answers.

---

# Notes:
- Focus on generating questions that reflect critical concepts from the given text.
- Ensure clarity and correctness in both questions and answers.
- Proportionately balance the mix of question types across the quiz.
- Avoid ambiguity in "correct_answer" or "correct_answers" fields by making answers explicit. 

This structured format will maintain consistency and ensure the generated quizzes are high-quality and easily parsable."""
